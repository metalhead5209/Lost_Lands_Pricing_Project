# Lost_Lands_Pricing_Project
will never be deployed just some practice with grid and responsiveness.


I created this simply to practice my CSS. I just got to the end of the CSS portion of my Web Dev Udemy course and I wanted to create a small project to practice what I've learned. This is is a pricing list for a music festival called Lost lands. It displays 3 different types of tickets you can purchase with pictures, descriptions, and links to the pages to purchase the tickets. I don't have any permissions to host or sell any sails or tickets so this will never be deployed. Site was made to practice my grid and responsive skills for CSS.
